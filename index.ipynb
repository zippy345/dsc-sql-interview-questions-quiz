    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    " * The 4 main datatpyes in Sqlite3 are:\n",
    "    > TEXT\n",
    "    > INTEGERS\n",
    "    > REAL\n",
    "    > BLOB\n",
    " * Yes. You can use common data types and syntax from other kinds of SQL, but it depends on which SQL database system (DBMS) you're working with.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* A primary key uniquely identifies each record within a table, while a foreign key establishes a link between tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* There are three types of entities\n",
    "  Which are :\n",
    "  * 1. ONE TO ONE\n",
    "       >  Each row in the first table is linked to exactly one row in the second table, and vice versa.\n",
    "    2. ONE TO MANY\n",
    "       >  A row in first table can be related to many rows in the second table, but each row in second table belongs to only one row in fisrt               table.\n",
    "    3. MANY TO MANY\n",
    "       >  Rows in first table can be linked to many rows in the second table, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* There are four main type of joins in sql. They are:\n",
    "   * 1. INNER JOIN\n",
    "        > returns  an output with only matching columns between the two tables that were being joined.\n",
    "     2. FULL/OUTER JOIN\n",
    "        > returns an output with all columns from the two tables being joined. \n",
    "     3. LEFT JOIN\n",
    "        > returns an output with all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table. If no match, fills with NULL\n",
    "     4. RIGHT JOIN\n",
    "        > returns an output with all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table. If no match, fills with NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* The GROUP BY statement splits the table into groups, and then the aggregate function summarizes each group\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "* An associative entity (join table) enables a many-to-many relationship in a relational database by linking two tables through foreign keys and optionally storing data about their association.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
